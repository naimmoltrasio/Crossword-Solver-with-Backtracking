# Crossword Solver with Backtracking Algorithm

## Description
This repository contains a Crossword Solver implemented in Python, employing the **Backtracking Algorithm** to tackle crossword puzzles. The solver aims to fill incomplete crossword grids accurately while considering intersecting words to ensure a coherent and valid solution using the 100 most common words in English.

### Features

-   Backtracking Algorithm: The core of this solver is based on the widely-used backtracking technique, which iteratively explores potential word combinations to find the optimal fit for the crossword grid.
    
-   Lexicon: The algorithm uses a dictionary containing the 100 most common words in English.
  
-   Clue Processing: The program intelligently processes the provided crossword clues, using them as constraints to guide the search for suitable words, mimicking the human-solving approach.

- Customization Options: Users can also add new words to the dictionary and experiment with crossword grid layouts.
    

### Usage

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required Python dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
3.  Run main.py
4.  Enjoy the generated solutions and explore the code to understand the backtracking algorithm's implementation.

### Applications

-   Crossword Enthusiasts: Use the solver to solve complex and challenging crossword puzzles, enhancing your crossword-solving skills.
-   Puzzle Constructors: Validate and optimize crossword grid designs, or create new puzzles by experimenting with various clue combinations.
-   Educational Purposes: The code can serve as a real-world example for teaching backtracking algorithms and computational problem-solving concepts.
